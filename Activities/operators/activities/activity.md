Arithmetic Operators:
Q1. Given two integer variables a and b, calculate and print the result of a divided by b using the division operator /. Handle any potential division by zero.

Assignment Operators:
Q2. Initialize an integer variable x with a value of 10. Using assignment operators, update x to 15 and then to 20.

Comparison Operators:
Q3. Write a program that takes two integer inputs, num1 and num2, and uses comparison operators to determine if num1 is equal to, greater than, or less than num2. Print appropriate messages for each case.

Logical Operators:
Q4. Create a program that takes a boolean input for two conditions: isSunny and isWarm. Use logical operators to determine if it's a good day for a picnic. Print "Good day for a picnic" if both conditions are true.

Bitwise Operators:
Q5. Given two integer variables a = 5 and b = 3, perform a bitwise AND operation between a and b and print the result in binary format.

Increment and Decrement Operators:
Q6. Initialize an integer variable count with a value of 5. Use the increment and decrement operators to increase count by 1 and then decrease it by 2.

Conditional (Ternary) Operator:
Q7. Write a program that takes an integer input representing a temperature in Celsius. Use the conditional (ternary) operator to convert it to Fahrenheit and print the result. The conversion formula is: Fahrenheit = Celsius \* 9/5 + 32.

Null Coalescing Operator:
Q8. Given a nullable integer variable age, use the null coalescing operator to assign a default value of 18 if age is null.

String Concatenation Operator:
Q9. Create a program that takes two string inputs, firstName and lastName. Use the string concatenation operator (+) to combine them and print the full name.

Relational Operators:
Q10. Write a program that takes an integer input representing a person's age. Use relational operators to check if the age is between 18 and 65 (inclusive). Print "Valid age" if it is, otherwise print "Invalid age."
