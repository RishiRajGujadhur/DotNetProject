0. Create a function named PrintNumbers that takes an integer parameter n and prints all numbers from 1 to n using a loop.

For Loop Activities:

1. Calculate Factorial:
   Write a function called CalculateFactorial that takes an integer parameter n and calculates and returns the factorial of n. Use a for loop to perform the calculation.

Print Multiplication Table: 
2. Write a program that takes an integer input from the user and uses a for loop to print the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.

While Loop Activities: 
3. Guess the Number:
Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and asks the user to guess the number. Use a while loop to keep asking for guesses until the user correctly guesses the number.

Sum of Digits:
 4. Write a function called SumOfDigits that takes an integer parameter and calculates and returns the sum of its digits using a while loop.

Foreach Loop Activities:
 5. Find Maximum Value:
Write a function called FindMaxValue that takes an array of integers as input and uses a foreach loop to find and return the maximum value in the array.

Average of Grades:
 6. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a list of student grades. Use a foreach loop to calculate and display the average grade.
Do-While Loop Activities: 7. User Menu with

Do-While: 
7. Write a program that displays a menu to the user with options (e.g., "1. Add," "2. Subtract," "3. Quit"). Use a do-while loop to keep displaying the menu until the user chooses to quit.

Factorial with Do-While: 
8. Write a function called CalculateFactorialWithDoWhile that takes an integer parameter n and calculates and returns the factorial of n using a do-while loop.
