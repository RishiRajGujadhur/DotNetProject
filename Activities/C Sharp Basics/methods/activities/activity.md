1. Define a function called CalculateFactorial that calculates and returns the factorial of a positive integer parameter.

Method Overloading:

2. Write a class called Calculator with overloaded methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These methods should take either two integers or two doubles as parameters and return the result.

Method Overriding:

3. Create a base class called Shape with a virtual method CalculateArea. Then, create two derived classes Circle and Rectangle that override the CalculateArea method to calculate the area of a circle and a rectangle, respectively.

Static Methods:

4. Design a class MathUtility with a static method CalculateAverage that calculates the average of an array of integers. Demonstrate how to use this method.

Extension Methods:

5. Create an extension method for the string class that counts the number of words in a given sentence. Use this extension method to count the words in a string.

Optional Parameters:

6. Implement a method called Greet that takes a person's name as a parameter and an optional greeting message. If the greeting message is not provided, use a default message like "Hello." Display the greeting.

Named Parameters:

7. Modify the Greet method from the previous task to accept named parameters for both the name and greeting message.

Async Methods:

8. Create an asynchronous method that simulates fetching data from a web API with a delay of 2 seconds. Use the async and await keywords to ensure non-blocking execution.

Lambda Expressions:

9. Create a method that uses a lambda expression to filter a list of integers and returns a new list containing only even numbers.

Delegate as a Method Parameter:

10. Design a method that accepts a delegate as a parameter and uses it to perform a specific operation on a list of integers. Pass different delegate functions to test different operations (e.g., sum, product, average).
