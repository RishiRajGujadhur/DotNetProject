Question 1: The output is 13.

Question 2: The output is HelloWorld.

Question 3: The output is 1 2 3 4 5.

Question 4: The output is 10.

Question 5: The output is Odd.

Question 6: The output is 15.

Question 7: The output is True.

Question 8: The output is 15.

Question 9: The output is 15.

Question 10: The output is True.

Question 11: The output is Even.

Question 12: The output is 1, 2, 4, 5.

Question 13: The output is 4.

Question 14: The output is 2.

Question 15: The output is 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4.

Question 16: The output is 15.

Question 17: The output is 42.

Explanation: The await keyword is used to asynchronously wait for the result of the GetValueAsync method, which has a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second). Once the task is completed, it returns 42, and the result is printed.

Question 18: The output is a sequence of numbers and letters. For example, it might be something like 1A2B3C4D5E.

Explanation: The PrintNumbersAsync and PrintLettersAsync methods are both asynchronous and print numbers and letters with delays, so they run concurrently. await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2); ensures that the program waits for both tasks to complete before continuing.

Question 19: The output is an unhandled exception.

Explanation: The code attempts to divide by zero (DivideAsync(10, 0)), which will result in an ArithmeticException. Since the exception is not caught or handled within the Main method, it will result in an unhandled exception, and the program may terminate.

Question 20: The output is an unhandled exception.

Explanation: The GetValueAsync method throws an exception with the message "An error occurred." Since there is no try-catch block to handle this exception, it will result in an unhandled exception, and the program may terminate.

Question 21: The output is "Index out of range."

Explanation: This code attempts to access an index that is out of the array bounds, resulting in an IndexOutOfRangeException. The catch block for IndexOutOfRangeException is executed, and "Index out of range" is printed.

Question 22: The output is "Divide by zero exception."

Explanation: The Divide method attempts to divide by zero, which is not allowed, resulting in a DivideByZeroException. The catch block for DivideByZeroException is executed, and "Divide by zero exception" is printed.

Question 23: The output is "Null reference exception."

Explanation: This code attempts to access the Length property of a null array, resulting in a NullReferenceException. The catch block for NullReferenceException is executed, and "Null reference exception" is printed.

Question 24: The output is "Format exception."

Explanation: This code attempts to parse the string "abc" into an integer using int.Parse, which will result in a FormatException because "abc" is not a valid integer. The catch block for FormatException is executed, and "Format exception" is printed.
