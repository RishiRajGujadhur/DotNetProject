Q0. Create a class named Person with properties Name and Age. Write a constructor to initialize these properties, and a method PrintInfo to display the person's information.

Creating a Class:
Q1. Define a class called Person with properties for Name, Age, and Address. Create an instance of this class and set its properties. Print the details of the person.

Class Constructors:
Q2. Modify the Person class from the previous question to include a constructor that initializes the properties. Create multiple Person objects using different constructors.

Class Methods:
Q3. Extend the Person class with a method called DisplayInfo that prints the person's information. Call this method on a Person object to display their details.

Static Members:
Q4. Create a class called MathHelper with a static method Add that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. Use this method to perform addition without creating an instance of the class.

Inheritance:
Q5. Define a base class called Vehicle with properties for Make, Model, and Year. Create a derived class called Car that inherits from Vehicle and includes additional properties like Color and FuelType.

Encapsulation:
Q6. Create a class called BankAccount with private fields for balance and accountNumber. Implement methods to deposit and withdraw funds while ensuring that the balance is not negative.

Object Initialization:
Q7. Create a class Book with properties for Title, Author, and PublicationYear. Initialize a list of Book objects with different book details.

Method Overloading:
Q8. Add overloaded constructors to the Person class to allow creating a person with just a name, with a name and age, and with a name, age, and address. Demonstrate creating Person objects using these constructors.

Access Modifiers:
Q9. Create a class Employee with private fields for employeeId, firstName, and lastName. Use properties to provide read-only access to these fields.

Class Relationships:
Q10. Define two classes, Student and Course, and establish a relationship between them. A student can enroll in multiple courses, and each course can have multiple students. Implement this relationship using appropriate data structures.
