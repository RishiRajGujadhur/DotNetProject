Basic If Statement:
A1. The if statement checks if the age variable is greater than or equal to 18. If true, it prints "You are an adult."

If-Else Statement:
A2. The program uses an if-else statement to check if an integer number is even or odd. If the condition is true (the number is even), it prints "Even"; otherwise, it prints "Odd."

Nested If Statements:
A3. The program uses nested if statements to compare num1 and num2 and prints appropriate messages based on the comparison result.

If-Else-If Ladder:
A4. The program uses an if-else if ladder to assign a letter grade based on the percentage provided. It prints the letter grade according to the rules specified.

Ternary Operator:
A5. Using the ternary conditional operator, the program assigns a letter grade based on the percentage provided and then prints the letter grade.

Multiple Conditions:
A6. The if statement checks if both isStudent and isEmployee are true. If true, it prints "Student and Employee."

Using Logical Operators:
A7. The program uses if statements with logical operators (&&, ||) to categorize the age into "child," "teen," "adult," or "senior" and then prints the appropriate category.

Using Switch Statements:
A8. The program uses a switch statement to determine if a given day of the week is a weekday, weekend day, or an invalid day, and then prints the result.

Checking Null Values:
A9. The if statement checks if the score variable has a value. If it does, it prints the score; otherwise, it prints "Score is not available."

Checking String Length:
A10. The program uses an if statement to check if the input string has a length greater than 5 characters. If it does, it prints "Long string"; otherwise, it prints "Short string."
