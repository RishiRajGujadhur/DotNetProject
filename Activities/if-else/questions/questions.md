Basic If Statement:
Q1. Given an integer variable age, write an if statement that checks if the age is greater than or equal to 18 and, if true, prints "You are an adult."

If-Else Statement:
Q2. Write a program that takes an integer input and uses an if-else statement to determine if the number is even or odd. Print "Even" if it's even and "Odd" if it's odd.

Nested If Statements:
Q3. Create a program that takes two integer inputs, num1 and num2. Use nested if statements to determine if num1 is greater than, equal to, or less than num2. Print appropriate messages like "num1 is greater," "num1 is equal to num2," or "num1 is less."

If-Else-If Ladder:
Q4. Write a program that takes an integer input representing a grade percentage. Use an if-else if ladder to assign a letter grade based on the following rules:

90% and above: "A"
80-89%: "B"
70-79%: "C"
60-69%: "D"
Below 60%: "F"
Print the letter grade.
Ternary Operator:
Q5. Rewrite the previous grade assignment program using the ternary conditional operator (? :) instead of an if-else if ladder.

Multiple Conditions:
Q6. Given two boolean variables, isStudent and isEmployee, write an if statement that checks if the person is both a student and an employee. If true, print "Student and Employee."

Using Logical Operators:
Q7. Create a program that takes an integer input representing an age. Use if statements with logical operators to determine if the age falls into the category of "child" (0-12), "teen" (13-19), "adult" (20-59), or "senior" (60 and above). Print the appropriate category.

Using Switch Statements:
Q8. Write a program that takes a string input representing a day of the week. Use a switch statement to determine if it's a weekday (Monday to Friday), a weekend day (Saturday or Sunday), or an invalid day. Print the result.

Checking Null Values:
Q9. Given a nullable integer variable score, write an if statement to check if it has a value. If it has a value, print the score; otherwise, print "Score is not available."

Checking String Length:
Q10. Create a program that takes a string input. Use an if statement to check if the string has a length greater than 5 characters. If it does, print "Long string"; otherwise, print "Short string."
