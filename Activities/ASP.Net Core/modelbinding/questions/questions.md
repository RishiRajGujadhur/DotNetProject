What Is Model Binding in ASP.NET Core:

Question 1: Explain the concept of model binding in ASP.NET Core. How does it work, and why is it important for handling HTTP requests?
Automatic Model Binding:

Question 2: How does automatic model binding work in ASP.NET Core? Describe the process by which incoming HTTP request data is automatically bound to action method parameters.
Model Binding Sources:

Question 3: What are the different sources from which model binding can retrieve data? Explain the key model binding sources, such as route values, query strings, form data, and JSON.
Binding to Simple Types:

Question 4: How can you bind simple types, like integers and strings, in action method parameters using model binding? Provide an example of binding a simple type from the route.
Binding to Complex Types:

Question 5: Describe how model binding works with complex types, such as custom classes or view models. What is required to bind data to complex type parameters?
Binding to Collections:

Question 6: How does model binding handle collections of data, such as arrays or lists? Explain how you can bind to collections in action method parameters.
Binding Prefixes:

Question 7: What is a binding prefix, and how can you use it to bind data to specific properties of a complex object? Provide an example of using a binding prefix.
Binding to Form Data:

Question 8: How can you bind data from HTML form elements to action method parameters using model binding? Explain the relationship between form element names and parameter names.
Binding to JSON Data:

Question 9: Describe how model binding handles JSON data in ASP.NET Core. What is required to bind JSON data to action method parameters?
Custom Model Binding:

Question 10: In what scenarios might you need custom model binding? Explain how to create a custom model binder and apply it to a specific parameter or type.
Binding to Query Strings and Route Values:

Question 11: How can you bind data from query strings and route values to action method parameters using model binding? Explain the syntax for specifying the source.
Binding to Route Data:

Question 12: Explain how model binding works with route data. What is the relationship between route data and action method parameters?
Binding to Header Data:

Question 13: Is it possible to bind data from HTTP headers to action method parameters using model binding? If so, how can you achieve this?
Model Binding Validation:

Question 14: How does model binding validation work in ASP.NET Core? What happens when model binding encounters invalid data, and how can you handle validation errors?
Binding to Nested Objects:

Question 15: Can model binding bind data to nested objects within a complex object? Describe the syntax and process for binding to nested properties.
