Authentication vs. Authorization:

Answer(1): Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, typically through credentials like username and password. Authorization, on the other hand, involves determining what actions or resources a user is allowed to access after they have been authenticated.
Authentication Middleware:

Answer(2): Authentication middleware in ASP.NET Core handles the process of verifying user identities. Common authentication middleware components include UseAuthentication for enabling authentication and UseAuthorization for enabling authorization. Popular authentication middleware includes JWT, OAuth, and OpenID Connect.
Authorization Middleware:

Answer(3): Authorization middleware in ASP.NET Core checks whether an authenticated user is allowed to access a particular resource or perform a specific action. The [Authorize] attribute is used to apply authorization rules to controller actions, restricting access to authorized users.

Authentication Providers:
Answer(4): Authentication providers are components that handle the authentication process. Examples include:
OAuth providers like Google, Facebook, and Twitter
OpenID Connect providers
Cookie authentication as a provider for storing authentication tokens
Identity providers for managing user identities

Role-Based Authorization:
Answer(5): Role - based authorization restricts access to parts of a web application based on a user's role. For example, you can use [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")] to ensure that only users with the "Admin" role can access a particular action.
Policy-Based Authorization:

Answer(6): Policy - based authorization allows you to create custom authorization policies and apply them using the [Authorize(Policy = "PolicyName")] attribute.You can define policies with specific requirements, such as checking user roles or custom logic.
JWT Authentication:

Answer(7): JWT authentication(JSON Web Token) is a widely used method for securing APIs. In ASP.NET Core, it involves validating JWT tokens issued by an authentication provider, extracting claims, and making authorization decisions based on the claims.
Cookie Authentication:

Answer(8): Cookie authentication in ASP.NET Core uses HTTP cookies to manage user sessions and authentication tokens. Configuration settings include specifying the login and logout paths, cookie name, and expiration.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):

Answer(9): Two - factor authentication(2FA) enhances security by requiring users to provide two forms of identification. ASP.NET Core supports 2FA, allowing users to use factors like a password and a one-time code sent to their phone or email.
External Authentication Providers:

Answer(11): Claims - based authentication is a method where user identities are represented as claims, which are key-value pairs. Claims can include user roles, permissions, and other identity information.
Identity Framework:

Answer(12): The ASP.NET Core Identity framework simplifies user authentication and management. It provides features for user registration, login, password management, role-based authorization, and user profile management.
Resource-Based Authorization:

Answer(13): Resource - based authorization focuses on controlling access to specific resources or actions in an application. It allows you to define fine-grained authorization rules based on the resource being accessed.
Token-Based Authentication for APIs:

Answer(14): Token - based authentication for APIs involves issuing access tokens to clients (e.g., mobile apps or SPA) after successful authentication. Clients include the access token in API requests, and the API validates and extracts claims from the token.
Authorization Policies:
